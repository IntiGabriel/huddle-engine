        <p>Welcome to Alderwood, Washington, a fictitious town in central Washington state.</p>
        <p>Already reeling from revelations of corruption and conspiracy, the people of Alderwood are left wondering “What next?”  The head of the Alderwood Police Department believes he has a hint toward the answer to that question.</p>
        <p>An incident from early 2004 (see The Alderwood News article from 1/16/2004 entitled “Intoxicated Driver Makes Unexpected Deposit at Alderwood National Bank”) has been nagging at him since it happened.  Now, with the FBI’s attention already focused on Alderwood, he has decided the time has come to shed some light on the situation.</p>
        <p>“This incident still doesn’t sit right with me.  Despite initial reports, no alcohol or drugs were found in the man’s blood.  That stuff he was spouting sounded like something you’d hear from a cult or something.  If not for all the recent goings on, I might think I was being paranoid.  I want this looked into.”</p>

        <p>Contestants:  Arm yourself with your best visual analytic tools to take over the ongoing investigation of the Alderwood activities.  The objective:  To identify evidence, generate hypotheses and formulate next-step action suggestions for additional information-gathering.  Your results will be presented to your 'supervisors' (the contest judges), and should include a diagram and explanation of the social network, hypotheses (there could be more than one) of what is going on, and suggestions for the field officers to gather additional supporting evidence.  The evidence presented should support your assertions of what the roles and relationships are and the motivations of the person(s) involved.  Good luck!</p>
